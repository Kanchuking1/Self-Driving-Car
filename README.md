# Self Driving Car using Genetic Algorithm

### Abstract 
The rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle technology has spurred the development of innovative algorithms to enhance the capabilities of self-driving cars. This paper introduces a JavaScript-based Genetic Training Algorithm (GTA) designed for the optimization of self-driving car navigation. The proposed algorithm leverages genetic principles such as selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve a population of potential solutions over successive generations.

The selection process involves the exploration of various selection strategies, including roulette wheel selection, tournament selection, and rank-based selection, to identify promising individuals for reproduction. The efficiency and effectiveness of each selection strategy are evaluated in the context of enhancing the algorithm's convergence speed and solution quality.

Crossover, a fundamental genetic operator, is investigated using different techniques such as one-point crossover, two-point crossover, and uniform crossover. The impact of these crossover strategies on the diversity of the population and the exploration-exploitation trade-off is thoroughly analyzed to ascertain their suitability for the self-driving car navigation task.

Furthermore, the paper delves into the realm of mutation, exploring diverse mutation operators like random mutation, boundary mutation, and non-uniform mutation. The goal is to examine the effects of these mutation strategies on introducing variability into the population, preventing premature convergence, and maintaining genetic diversity.

The performance of the proposed GTA is evaluated through extensive simulations, considering real-world self-driving scenarios. Comparative analyses are conducted to assess the algorithm's efficiency and robustness in optimizing the navigation parameters for autonomous vehicles.

In conclusion, this research contributes to the field of autonomous vehicle navigation by presenting a comprehensive exploration of different genetic training algorithm components, specifically tailored to the challenges of self-driving car optimization. The insights gained from this study can guide future efforts in developing more sophisticated algorithms for enhancing the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicle systems.
